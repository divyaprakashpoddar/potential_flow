1. Demonstrate the plotting of a streamfunction/potential function as
   a function of X,Y using scatter3D plot.
2. Plot contour lines in the above plot in 3D.
3. Plot the contour line of both functions in 2D

Note: Don't mention contour lines while explaining. It may confuse 
      them.

m1: normal 2D plot
m2: contour plot
m3: streamplot

sup2_m3: Superposition of Line Vortex and Line Sink
sup3_m3: Superposition of Source and Sink (Doublet)
sup4_m3: Superposition of Line Vortex and Doublet
sup5_m3: Superposition of Source and Sink
